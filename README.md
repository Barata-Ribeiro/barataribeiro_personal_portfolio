# Hello,🖖 there! Welcome to My Personal Portfolio

## 🎨 Front-End Developer & UI Designer

I developed this portfolio starting with the UI Design using Figma, and then the code was written using NextJs with
TypeScript, alongside Tailwind CSS as the style framework. I've used a combination of fonts, such as `Roboto` and
`Kanit`, with `Comfortaa` for the decorator. I chose the color palette using the following as a base: ![#838073](https://placehold.co/15x15/838073/838073.png) `#838073`, ![#2b81e3](https://placehold.co/15x15/2b81e3/2b81e3.png)
`#2b81e3`,![#d2d904](https://placehold.co/15x15/d2d904/d2d904.png) `#d2d904`. The images used in both the hero and
about sections are from Unsplash.
Check out my projects and education, and let's discuss working together!

## 🚀 Built with (high level)

- Next.js (v15) with Turbopack
- React (v19)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

## 🛠️ Project setup

You need Node.js and pnpm installed. This project uses pnpm as the package manager and the repository's scripts
are configured to run with Turbopack by default.

1. Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Barata-Ribeiro/barataribeiro_personal_portfolio.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```powershell
cd barataribeiro_personal_portfolio
```

3. Install dependencies (pnpm):

```powershell
pnpm install
```

4. Start the local development server (recommended):

```powershell
pnpm dev
```

Notes:
- The package.json includes a "dev" script that runs `next dev --turbopack`. If you prefer npm you can still use
  `npm run dev`, but `pnpm` is the project's intended package manager.
- The development server will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔮 Future Goals

I'm constantly expanding my skill set and venturing further into the realms of front-end development and UI design. My
goal is to create visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces that enhance user experience and effectively translate
business strategy into digital solutions.
