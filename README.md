# Hello,🖖 there! Welcome to My Personal Portfolio

## 🎨 Front-End Developer & UI Designer

I developed this portfolio starting with the UI Design using Figma, and then the code was written using React + Vite with Tailwind CSS as the style framework. I've used a combination of fonts, such as `Roboto` and `Kanit`, with `Comfortaa` for the decorator. I chose the color palette using the following as a base: ![#838073](https://placehold.co/15x15/838073/838073.png) `#838073`, ![#2b81e3](https://placehold.co/15x15/2b81e3/2b81e3.png) `#2b81e3`, ![#d2d904](https://placehold.co/15x15/d2d904/d2d904.png) `#d2d904`. The images used in both the hero and about sections are from Unsplash. Check out my projects and education, and let's discuss working together!
